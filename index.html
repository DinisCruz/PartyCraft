<p>PartyCraft is a 3rd-party Minecraft server based on <a href="https://github.com/SirCmpwn/Craft.Net">Craft.Net</a>.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>PartyCraft is incomplete. However, it aims to eventually reproduce the functionality of the vanilla
Minecraft server. In addition, PartyCraft should use significantly less CPU and memory on the host
machine when operating a server. For more information on progress, see the latest
<a href="https://github.com/SirCmpwn/PartyCraft/issues/milestones">Milestone</a>.</p>

<p>If there are any additional features you would like, or any problems you encounter while using
PartyCraft, please do not hesitate to <a href="https://github.com/SirCmpwn/Craft.Net/issues">create an issue</a>.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>On Linux and Mac, you will need to install <a href="https://github.com/mono/mono">Mono</a> first.</p>

<p>Simply run PartyCraft.exe from the command line (Linux/Mac: "mono PartyCraft.exe") to start the server.
If a world is not found in the same directory (in the "world" subdirectory by default), it will be
created. The default world generator is flatland. If an Anvil world does exist in the specified directory,
PartyCraft will use the existing world.</p>

<p>If a vanilla-style server.properties file is provided, PartyCraft will use it. Otherwise, a config.xml
file will be produced and populated with default values. You may use a plugin to change the settings format,
such as JSON, YML, or SQL.</p>

<p>After starting the server at the command line, you should be free to connect to it.</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>

<p>If you wish to contribute your own code to PartyCraft, please create a fork. You are encouraged to follow the
code standards currently in use, and pull requests that do not will be rejected. You are also encouraged to
make small, focused pull requests, rather than large, sweeping changes. For such changes, it would be better
to create an issue instead.</p>

<h2>Getting Help</h2>

<p>You can get help by making an <a href="https://github.com/SirCmpwn/PartyCraft/issues">issue on GitHub</a>, or joining
