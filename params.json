However, it aims to eventually reproduce the functionality of the vanilla\r\nMinecraft server. In addition, PartyCraft should use significantly less CPU and memory on the host\r\nmachine when operating a server. For more information on progress, see the latest\r\n[Milestone](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/PartyCraft/issues/milestones).\r\n\r\nIf there are any additional features you would like, or any problems you encounter while using\r\nPartyCraft, please do not hesitate to [create an issue](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/Craft.Net/issues).\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nOn Linux and Mac, you will need to install [Mono](https://github.com/mono/mono) first.\r\n\r\nSimply run PartyCraft.exe from the command line (Linux/Mac: \"mono PartyCraft.exe\") to start the server.\r\nIf a world is not found in the same directory (in the \"world\" subdirectory by default), it will be\r\ncreated. The default world generator is flatland. If an Anvil world does exist in the specified directory,\r\nPartyCraft will use the existing world.\r\n\r\nIf a vanilla-style server.properties file is provided, PartyCraft will use it. Otherwise, a config.xml\r\nfile will be produced and populated with default values. You may use a plugin to change the settings format,\r\nsuch as JSON, YML, or SQL.\r\n\r\nAfter starting the server at the command line, you should be free to connect to it.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you wish to contribute your own code to PartyCraft, please create a fork. You are encouraged to follow the\r\ncode standards currently in use, and pull requests that do not will be rejected. You are also encouraged to\r\nmake small, focused pull requests, rather than large, sweeping changes. For such changes, it would be better\r\nto create an issue instead.\r\n\r\n## Getting Help\r\n\r\nYou can get help by making an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/PartyCraft/issues), or joining\r\n\\#craft.net on irc.freenode.net. If you are already knowledgable about using PartyCraft, consider contributing\r\nto the [wiki](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/PartyCraft/wiki) for the sake of others.\r\n\r\n## Licensing\r\n\r\nPartyCraft uses the permissive [MIT license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php/).\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell:\r\n\r\n* You are not restricted on usage of PartyCraft; commercial, private, etc, all fine.\r\n* The developers are not liable for what you do with it.\r\n* PartyCraft is provided \"as is\" with no warranty.\r\n\r\n[Minecraft](http://minecraft.net/) is not officially affiliated with PartyCraft.","name":"Partycraft","google":""}
